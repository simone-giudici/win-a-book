## Maximum without comparators

Write a function that takes 2 integers and returns the greater
of them, or one of them if they are equal.
You should not use comparators such as `>`, `<`, `==`, `Math.Max()`, `if`, `then`,
`else`, `switch` and the like.

Example:

```
Max(0, 0) => 0
Max(10, 0) => 10
Max(0, 10) => 10
Max(-1, 0) => 0
Max(-1, 1) => 1
Max(-10, -1) => -1
```
